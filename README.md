# Philly Crime

## For our project, we took an aim at applying quick sort and merge sort to a data set that contains information about crimes that occured within the Philadelphia area from recent years. This dataset was found on Kaggle and has information such as when and where the crime took place along with the type of crime that it was. Just for example, we can see that some common themse in these crimes were thefts, vandalism or assaults.

## How the project works

### Our sorting algorithms will ensure that the program neatly organizes the data based on the user's input. So if a user wanted to view the crime type, they could type that into the prompt and the system will organize and arrange the dataset appropriately based on the prompt. In addition to this, there will be a graph that outputs a visualization of the organized data.

## Significance of project

### Our Philly Crime project is significant because it utilizes the important concepts that we learned in class. It helps us understand more about the topic of sorting
